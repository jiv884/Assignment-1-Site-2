        <div id="a1">Imagine such a scene: A new guy starts working at your company. A week goes by, and you have a few uninteresting interactions. 
        <br>
        He seems nice enough, but you’re busy and not paying particularly close attention.
        <br>
        On Friday, in the elevator, he asks you out. Suddenly, the details of all of your prior encounters resurface and consolidate in your memory. 
        <br>
        They have retroactively gone from unremarkable to important, and your brain has adjusted accordingly. 
        <br>
        Or, in a more negative guise, if you’re bitten by a dog in a new neighborhood, your memory of all the dogs that you had seen since moving there might improve. 
        <br>
        So, if memory for events is strengthened at emotional times, why does everyone forget what they were doing when the “challenger” of your memory exploded? 
        <br>
        While the memory of the event itself is enhanced, the vividness of the memory of the central event tends to come at the expense of the details. 
        <br>
        We experience a sort of tunnel vision, discarding all the details that seem incidental to the central event.

        <div id="a2">Medical News Today spoke to Sam Berens, Ph.D., who is currently a research assistant at the University of York in the United Kingdom, and he explained to us that natural forgetting can be due to a few different reasons.
        <br>
        "Forgetting occurs because it would not be energy efficient to indefinitely maintain all the memories that we form each day."
        <br>
        "It also seems to be a natural consequence of neurogenesis — the process that creates new brain cells in support of future learning." 
        <br>
        "Because of this, clearing old and unused memories may be directly related to our ability to learn new things," He told MNT.
        <br>
        But scientists continue to explore the many complications that riddle memory recall and formation. 
        <br>
        For instance, not all our memories are correct, and sometimes our brains "implement" forgetting as a defense mechanism.
        <br>
        "Memory conformity may also serve an adaptive purpose because social learning is often more efficient and accurate than individual learning," which is not always reliable. 
        <br>
        For instance, as studies have shown, the process of memory retrieval can mean that the original memory is rewritten — with the memory of that memory — so that the original memory becomes warped.

        <div id="a3">In the Academy-Awards-winning film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the broken-up couple, Joel and Clementine, went to a clinic to take a surgery to erase the memory of each other in order to get rid of the pain and trauma that their break-up brought. 
        <br>
        Below is selected from the manuscript, describing how the surgery works, and the theory of memory behind it.
        <br>
        “We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards."
        <br>
        "There is an emotional core to each of our memories."
        <br>
        "As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process."
        <br>
        "By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking."
        <br>
        "Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll miss."
        <br>
        "We use the articles you brought to create a map of Clementine in your brain. "
        <br>
        "Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to trace the map and erase."
        <br>
        "We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.  That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home."
